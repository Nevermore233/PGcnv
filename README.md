# PGcnv: Pangenome-based Incremental Learning Framework for Shallow Copy Number Variation Detection

## Overview
PGcnv is a framework for detecting shallow copy number variations (CNVs) using a pangenome-based incremental learning approach. This repository provides tools for data preprocessing, CNV pre-detection with a CUSUM control chart (ZIP-Caller), and subsequent generation of bubbles, phylogenetic trees, and CNV relationship networks.

## Installation
Uncompress the installation package using the following commands:

```bash
cd /my/install/dir/
unzip /path/to/PGcnv.zip
